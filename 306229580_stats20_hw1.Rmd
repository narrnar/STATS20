## Question 1

### (a)
<!-- ENTER YOUR ANSWER BELOW -->
"**Sometimes you have to make the hardest climbs to see the most beautiful sunrise.** I read that once on an old lady's decorative pillow, but it is really how I feel today. I've climbed a very weird and rocky mountain, and it was a pain in the ass, and my legs are tired, and I'm starving. But *the sun is rising over a sea of love and waffles and possibility.* So *I'm just gonna relax and take a deep breath and enjoy this view for as long as I possibly can.*" - Leslie Knope (from **Parks and Recreation**)

## Question 2

### (a)
<!-- ENTER YOUR ANSWER BELOW -->
The relevance of these videos in context to the class would be instructions on how to write and utilize R programming. Some steps may seem easy enough to be self-explanatory but may be confusing to those who are new to the language. If it seems as if the professor, TAs, or peers are overly explaining a solution, it is so that everyone can understand rather than assuming everyone understands certain steps. 

### (b)
<!-- ENTER YOUR ANSWER BELOW -->
1. Turn on stove to roughly medium heat. \
2. Place pan onto stove-top that is being used/on. \  
3. Pour a teaspoon of oil into pan. \
4. Grab two slices of bread from the pantry. \
5. Place both slices onto the pan. \
6. Grab your choice of cheese. \
7. Take out cheese from container and place desired amount onto both slices of bread. \
8. Once the slices of bread and cheese have melted/cooked to the desired amount, take the slices and place them onto a plate(can be found in your kitchen). \
9. Place one slice on top of the other and squeeze lightly. \ 10. Cut the grilled cheese in your desired fashion. \
11. Consume the grilled cheese. \
12. Clean up kitchen and place ingredients back into their original place. \

<!-- CREATE THE OBJECTS IN THE CODE CHUNK BELOW -->
<!-- NAME THE OBJECTS EXACTLY AS STATED IN THE ASSIGNMENT -->
```{r Question 4a}
vol_1 <- (4 / 3) * pi * (1^3)

## Question 5

### (a)
<!-- CREATE THE FUNCTION IN THE CODE CHUNK BELOW -->
<!-- NAME THE FUNCTION AND ITS INPUTS EXACTLY AS STATED IN THE ASSIGNENT -->
```{r Question 5a}
z_prop <- function(x, n, p0) {
  ## (p^ - p_0) / sqrt((p_0*(1 - p_0)) / n)
  sample_prop <- x / n # Calculate p^(sample proportion)
  std_err <- sqrt((p0 * (1 - p0)) / n) # Calculate denom(standard error)
  (sample_prop - p0) / std_err # Calculate z prop eqn
}
```
Sample proportion $\hat{p}$ is related to the input arguments by being the recorded proportion which is different from the hypothesized proportion. In order to get a value for the $\hat{p}$ (sample proportion), the number of observed successed is diveded by the number of trials ran.

### (b)
<!-- USE THE CODE CHUNK BELOW -->
```{r Question 5b}
z_prop <- function(x, n, p0) {
  ## (p^ - p_0) / sqrt((p_0*(1 - p_0)) / n)
  sample_prop <- x / n # Calculate p^(sample proportion)
  std_err <- sqrt((p0 * (1 - p0)) / n) # Calculate denom(standard error)
  (sample_prop - p0) / std_err # Calculate z prop eqn
}
z_prop(10, 13, 0.6)
```

### (c)
<!-- ENTER YOUR ANSWER BELOW -->
The z-statistic from b is 1.245505, which indicates a deviation from the mean. Depending on whether or not the test is one-tail or two-tail, the significance level can be determined by this z-statstic value. The individual value is greater than the mean in this case due to it being a positive value.

### (d)
<!-- USE THE CODE CHUNK BELOW -->
```{r Question 5d}
z_prop <- function(x, n, p0) {
  ## (p^ - p_0) / sqrt((p_0*(1 - p_0)) / n)
  sample_prop <- x / n # Calculate p^(sample proportion)
  std_err <- sqrt((p0 * (1 - p0)) / n) # Calculate denom(standard error)
  (sample_prop - p0) / std_err # Calculate z prop eqn
}
z_prop(30, 39, 0.6)
```
<!-- ENTER YOUR EXPLANATION BELOW -->
Although the sample proportion remained constant, the z-statistic has changed because the number of trials has tripled. The increase in the number of trials has made the standard error smaller which results in a bigger z-statistic. 

## Question 6

### (a)
<!-- CREATE THE FUNCTION IN THE CODE CHUNK BELOW -->
<!-- NAME THE FUNCTION AND ITS INPUTS EXACTLY AS STATED IN THE ASSIGNENT -->
```{r Question 6a}
# lease calculating function
lease_calc <- function(msrp, price, down, n = 36, res = 0.60, mf = 0.001, tax = 0.095) {
  cap_cost <- price - down
  res_val <- msrp * res
  mo_depr <- (cap_cost - res_val) / n
  mo_charge <- (cap_cost + res_val) * mf
  
  sub_total <- mo_depr + mo_charge
  total <- sub_total + (sub_total * tax)
  
  # return(total) not allowed
  total
}
```

### (b)
<!-- USE THE CODE CHUNK BELOW -->
```{r Question 6b}
# lease calculating function
lease_calc <- function(msrp, price, down, n = 36, res = 0.60, mf = 0.001, tax = 0.095) {
  cap_cost <- price - down
  res_val <- msrp * res
  mo_depr <- (cap_cost - res_val) / n
  mo_charge <- (cap_cost + res_val) * mf
  
  sub_total <- mo_depr + mo_charge
  total <- sub_total + (sub_total * tax)
  
  # return(total) not allowed
  total
}

lease_calc(31495, 29895, 2500, 36, 0.52, 0.0016, 0.095)
```
Monthly lease payment for the car above is $411.81

   - Get number of dimes
   - Get remainder of cents
       - If there is a remainder, check other coins

    - Get remainder of cents
       - If there is a remainder, check number of pennies
- Check number of pennies
    - Get number of pennies

    - Output number of coins

### (c)
<!-- CREATE THE FUNCTION IN THE CODE CHUNK BELOW -->
<!-- NAME THE FUNCTION AND ITS INPUTS EXACTLY AS STATED IN THE ASSIGNENT -->
```{r Question 7c}

get_minimum_coins <- function(cents) {
  no_quart <- cents %/% 25
  remainder <- cents %% 25

  no_dimes <- remainder %/% 10
  remainder <- remainder %% 10

  no_nicks <- remainder %/% 5
  remainder <- remainder %% 5

  no_penns <- remainder %/% 1

  whole <- no_quart + no_dimes + no_nicks + no_penns
  # return(whole) not allowed
  whole
}

 # --- With For-Loop but future ch ---
# get_minimum_coins <- function(cents){
#   coin_vals <- c(25, 10, 5, 1)
#   
#   no_coins <- 0 
#   for(coin in coin_vals){ # Iterate through each coin
#     no_coins <- no_coins + (cents %/% coin) # Get the number of coins 
#     cents <- cents %% coin # Update remainder
#   }
#   return(no_coins)
# }
```

### (d)
<!-- USE THE CODE CHUNK BELOW -->
```{r Question 7d}
get_minimum_coins(31) # Ans = 3 coins
get_minimum_coins(48) # Ans = 6 coins
get_minimum_coins(139) # Ans = 10 coins
```

(i) <!-- ENTER YOUR ANSWER TO THE RIGHT OF THIS OR BELOW -->    3

(ii) <!-- ENTER YOUR ANSWER TO THE RIGHT OF THIS OR BELOW -->    6

(iii) <!-- ENTER YOUR ANSWER TO THE RIGHT OF THIS OR BELOW -->    10

### (e)
<!-- USE THE CODE CHUNK BELOW -->
```{r Question 7e}
get_minimum_coins(94)
get_minimum_coins(99)
```
<!-- ENTER YOUR EXPLANATION BELOW -->
The most coins possible while staying under 100 cents would be 94 and 99 cents. Both require 9 coins where three quarters, one dime, one nickel, and four pennies or three quarters, two dimes, and four pennies are used. The get_minimum_coins() function also displays that both answers will require 9 coins.

## Question 8
<!-- THIS IS THE CODE GIVEN IN THE ASSIGNMENT -->
```{r Question 8 Background, echo = TRUE}
x <- 3
y <- 4
exp1 <- function() {
  x^y
}
exp2 <- function(x = 2) {
  x^y
}
exp_y <- function(x) {
  function(y) {
    x^y
  }
}
```

### (a)
<!-- ENTER YOUR ANSWER BELOW -->
In the the r-block, x and y are first initialzied to values. exp1 does not change any of the values but in exp2's function argument, the x is initialized to 2 instead of 3. This results in exp2 being 16 instead of 81.

### (b)
<!-- ENTER YOUR ANSWER BELOW -->
exp_y() does not throw a code as it is calling a function within its own function. The output is the function(y) defined within the exp_y() function which is displayed in addition to the message: "<environment: random location/address>". 

### (c)
<!-- USE THE CODE CHUNK BELOW -->
```{r Question 8c}
# exp_y(x)(y)
exp_y(15)(4)
```
exp_y(15)(4) = 50625
